<div id="p1" class=""><div class= "Title">Crow and the Pitcher</div> 
<p><div class="content">In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink,<br>a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. <br> But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, <br> and no matter how he tried, <br> the Crow could not reach the water. <br>The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.<img src="crow+and+pitcher.jpg" id="Crow"> <br>
Then an idea came to him. <br> Picking up some small pebbles, <br>he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. <br> With each pebble the water rose a little higher, <br> until at last it was near enough so he could drink.</div></p></div>

That was against the rule. <br>
It made the children laugh and play <br>
To see a lamb at school.</div></p></div>
